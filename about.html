            <p>ABBA are a Swedish pop group 
                formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, 
                Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an 
                acronym of the first letters of their first names. They became 
                one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of 
                popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. 
                ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, 
                UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest. They are 
                the most successful group to have taken part in the competition.
                Estimates of ABBA's total record sales are at least 400 
                million records worldwide, making them one of the 
                best-selling music artists of all time.[4] They are the 
                best-selling band from continental Europe, and also from 
                outside the English-speaking world.[citation needed] ABBA 
                are the first group from a non-English-speaking country to 
                achieve consistent success in the charts of English-speaking 
                countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, 
                Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. 
                They have a joint record eight consecutive number-one albums in 
                the UK.[6] The group also enjoyed significant success in Latin 
                America, and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish.

                    After ABBA disbanded in December 1982, Andersson and Ulvaeus 
                    achieved success writing music for the stage,[8][9] while 
                    Lyngstad and Fältskog pursued solo careers with mixed success. 
                    ABBA's music declined in popularity until the purchase of ABBA's 
                    catalogue and record company Polar by Polygram in 1989 enabled the 
                    groundwork to be laid for an international re-issue of all their 
                    original material and a new Greatest Hits (ABBA Gold) collection 
                    in September 1992, which became a worldwide bestseller. Several 
                    films, notably Muriel's Wedding (1994) and The Adventures of Priscilla, 
                    Queen of the Desert (1994), further revived interest in the group and 
                    spawned several tribute bands. In 1999, ABBA's music was adapted into 
                    the successful musical Mamma Mia! that toured worldwide. A film of the 
                    same name, released in 2008, became the highest-grossing film in the 
                    United Kingdom that year. A sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was 
                    released in 2018.
